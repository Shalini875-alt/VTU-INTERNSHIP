      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>
    My journey into programming started with curiosity and slowly turned into 
  passion. From building simple HTML pages to developing full-stack web 
  applications and machine learning projects, every step helped me grow as a 
  developer. What began as experimenting with basic web design soon evolved 
  into creating dynamic websites, backend systems, and intelligent models that 
  solve real-world problems.

  I enjoy solving challenges through logic and creativity, whether it’s designing 
  responsive user interfaces, developing Flask-based applications, or training 
  machine learning models for smart predictions. Each project teaches me something 
  new and motivates me to explore deeper into technology.

Coding for long hours can be intense, so I never forget my little tea breaks. 
  A cup of chai, some fresh air, and a calm mind help me recharge and come back 
  stronger. Interestingly, many bugs get solved and ideas click during these 
  small pauses. It reminds me that productivity is not just about typing code 
  nonstop, but also about giving the mind time to breathe and think creatively.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>

     After a refreshing tea break, I return to my desk with renewed energy and a 
  clear mind. The screen lights up, the keyboard starts clicking, and ideas flow 
  faster than before. With better focus and motivation, I dive back into coding, 
  fixing bugs, building features, and turning concepts into working solutions. 
  Every small step brings me closer to becoming a better developer. For me, 
  this cycle of work, rest, and learning keeps the passion alive and the progress
